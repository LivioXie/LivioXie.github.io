<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Computer Science student at the University at Albany, graduate in May 2025. I have practical experience in full-stack development, operating systems, and AI projects. I'm skilled in Java, JavaScript, and React Native, with a specialization in front-end development and UI/UX design. I am seeking a software engineering role where I can apply my technical skills, collaborate with a team, and continue learning. I am fluent in English, Spanish, and Chinese.

<span style="float:right;">
  <i>January 2025 - May 2025</i>
</span>
<br>
        <i>Course Project of Capstone (ICSI-499)</i>
        <br>
Designed and implemented the complete user interface for an event management app using React Native, ensuring seamless cross-platform functionality on both iOS and Android devices. Developed detailed user flows and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, optimizing layouts for mobile phones and tablets. Programmed real-time ticket tracking features, integrated QR code scanning for event check-in and registration, and established API communication with the Node.js back-end. Coordinated development tasks, managed version control, and resolved merge conflicts collaboratively using Git throughout the project lifecycle.

- [Operating System Simulator â€“ Java] <a href="https://github.com/LivioXie/OperationSystem" target="_blank">[Project Page]</a>
<span style="float:right;">
          <i>January 2024 - May 2024</i>
        </span>
                <br>
        <i>Course Project of Operating Systems (ICSI-412)</i>
        <br>
I developed a Java-based operating system simulation that demonstrates key OS concepts, including process management, virtual memory with paging and swapping, device and file I/O, and inter-process communication. This project features modular, object-oriented design, supports dynamic memory allocation and protection, and uses Java threads to simulate process execution and scheduling. I also created test programs to verify the correctness and robustness of your systemâ€™s core functionalities.

- [GAN-Based Puzzle Generator and AI Solver] <a href="https://github.com/LivioXie/PuzzleSolving" target="_blank">[Project Page]</a>
 <span style="float:right;">
          <i>August 2024 - December 2024</i>
        </span>
        <br>
        <i>Course Project of Artificial Intelligence (ICSI-435)</i>
        <br>
 I designed and implemented a comprehensive Python project for 3x3 sliding puzzles, featuring both classic and AI-based solutions. My work included developing algorithms to generate random and solvable puzzles, implementing an efficient A* search solver, and building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and Keras to create new puzzle configurations. I ensured the validity and solvability of generated puzzles through post-processing, and developed a Pygame-based graphical interface for step-by-step visualization. 

- [ShankInterpreter â€“ Language Interpreter] <a href="https://github.com/LivioXie/ShankInterpreter" target="_blank">[Project Page]</a>
 <span style="float:right;">
          <i>August 2024 - December 2024</i>
        </span>
                <br>
        <i>Course Project of Principles Programming Languages (ICSI-311)</i>
        <br>
I developed a Java-based interpreter for the Shank programming language, implementing core components such as a lexer for tokenizing input, a parser for building abstract syntax trees, and an interpreter for executing both built-in and user-defined functions. 
This project supports essential language features including functions, variables, assignments, conditionals, loops, and function calls. I also integrated semantic analysis for type checking and variable validation, and provided robust error handling for lexical, syntactic, and semantic issues.
