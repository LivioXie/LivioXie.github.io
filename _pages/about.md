<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Computer Science student at the University at Albany, expected to graduate in May 2025. I have practical experience in full-stack development, operating systems, and AI projects. I'm skilled in Java, Python, JavaScript, and React Native, with a specialization in front-end development and UI/UX design. I am seeking a software engineering role where I can apply my technical skills, collaborate with a team, and continue learning. I am fluent in English, Spanish, and Chinese.
